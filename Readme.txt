This application uses a SharePoint 2013 list to feed data into a single page application which displays the list data in a drillable
accordian format.  The application which displays the list data is built using REST API queried json displayed using jQuery UI.  Original
design done using PhotoShop and Illustrator.  The screen shot images in the image folder show the end result of how the UI looks on the
client side.  The data is fed to the applicaiton using a simple SP2013 custom list which allows the users to add/update/delete the data
without having to manage code.
